## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Convex CLI (`npm install -g convex`)
- A Convex project set up (`npx convex dev`)

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/your-username/nexus.git
cd nexus

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run Convex backend
npx convex dev

# Run frontend
npm run dev
```

### Initial Setup

First, create an empty `.env.local` file in the project root directory and run the following to link a Convex account.

```bash
npm run dev
```

**Note:** When prompted, choose to use a remote Convex account and login or signup in your browser.

Then, run the following:

```bash
node ./scripts/generateKeys.mjs
```

and copy the resulting `JWT_PRIVATE_KEY` and `JWKS` environmental variables into your convex dashboard under Settings > Environmental Variables.

Finally, obtain an `OPENROUTER_API_URL` token from the OpenRouter dashboard and paste it into the Convex dashboard as well.
